# Redirecting input

## Procedure
I started the challenge, and connected the terminal<br>
and then i used ` echo COLLEGE > PWN`  and used `/challenge/run < PWN` to redirect input and then i got
the flag, i pasted that into the flag box.

## bash
Connected!
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ggiin-A4PNCtIFBdasQdFf4SJe7.dBzN1QDL3kTN0czW}`
