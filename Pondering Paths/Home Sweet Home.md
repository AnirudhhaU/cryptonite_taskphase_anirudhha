## Procedure
I started Home sweet home.
I went to Ubuntu terminal and typed `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college`
It connected ubuntu to pwn.college with ssh
Then i typed `/challenge/run ~/a`
and got the flag `pwn.college{wsr0Rgd17CSbzLiqth3onSZaWmS.dNzM4QDL3kTN0czW}`

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/h
Writing the file to /home/hacker/h!
... and reading it back to you:
