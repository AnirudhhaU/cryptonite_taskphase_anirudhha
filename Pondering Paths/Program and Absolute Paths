# Program and Absolute Paths

## Procedure
I started Intro to Commands challenge.
I went to Ubuntu terminal and typed `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college`
It connected ubuntu to pwn.college with ssh
Then i typed `/challenge/run`
and got the flag `pwn.college{4zfCK3DQMg0e-Uc5mo1Y1JfdEGN.dVDN1QDL3kTN0czW}`

## bash
`hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4zfCK3DQMg0e-Uc5mo1Y1JfdEGN.dVDN1QDL3kTN0czW}`
