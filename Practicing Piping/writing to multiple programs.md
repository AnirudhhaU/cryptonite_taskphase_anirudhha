# writing to multiple programs

## Procedure
I started the challenge, and connected the terminal<br>
and then i used ` /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)`  and then got
the flag, i pasted that into the flag box.

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.
