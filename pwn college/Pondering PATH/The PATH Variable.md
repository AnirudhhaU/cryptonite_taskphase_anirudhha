# The PATH variable

## Procedure
i started the challenge pwn.college
as per the question.  
then i typed `PATH=""` to remove the rm command from the shell and then i used  `/challenge/run`
then i pasted my flag to the website.

## Bash
`  Connected!
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=""
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
