# matching with *

## Procedure
I started matching with * and after connecting to pwn college through ssh
Then i typed `cd /?ha??enge`and 
then i used `/challenge/run`to find flag 
got the flag ` pwn.college{EXymyMkXX8wuH1Ijwv0QJLtXIZ_.dJjM4QDL3kTN0czW}`

## bash
`Connected!
This challenge resets your working directory to /home/hacker unless you change
directory properly...
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EXymyMkXX8wuH1Ijwv0QJLtXIZ_.dJjM4QDL3kTN0czW}`                                                                `
