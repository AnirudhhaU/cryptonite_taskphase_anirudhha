# Setting PATH

## Procedure
i started the challenge pwn.college
as per the question.  
then i typed `PATH=/challenge/more_commands/` and then i used  `/challenge/run`
then i pasted my flag to the website.

## Bash
` Connected!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ win
It looks like 'win' was improperly launched. Don't launch it directly; it MUST
be launched by /challenge/run!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
