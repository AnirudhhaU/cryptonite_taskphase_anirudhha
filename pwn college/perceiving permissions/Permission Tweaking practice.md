# Permission tweaking practice

## Procedure
i started the challenge pwn.college
as per the question.  
then i typed `/challenge/run` and then i typed a series of commands to change permission as needed
1. `chmod uga+x /challenge/pwn`
2. `chmod ug-rw /challenge/pw`
3. `chmod ug-x /challenge/pwn`
4. `chmod a-r /challenge/pwn`
5. `chmod u+w /challenge/pwn`
6. `chmod ug+r /challenge/pwn`
7. `chmod a+r /challenge/pwn`
8. `chmod ug+x /challenge/pwn`
   then i changed the read permission of `/flag` by using `chmod ugoa+r /flag ` and then i used `cat /flag`
then i pasted my flag to the website.

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!
Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod ugoa+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
