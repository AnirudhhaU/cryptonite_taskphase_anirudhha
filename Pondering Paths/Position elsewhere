# Position elsewhere

## Procedure
I started position elsewhere.
I went to Ubuntu terminal and typed `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college`
It connected ubuntu to pwn.college with ssh
Then i typed `/challenge/run`
i got incorrect 
and it was in a differnet directory
so to change directory i typed `cd /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu`
and then i  typed `/challenge/run`
and got the flag `pwn.college{EPdhBzrih3XShsKDgNHR8KdABbJ.ddDN1QDL3kTN0czW}`

## bash
`Connected!
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EPdhBzrih3XShsKDgNHR8KdABbJ.ddDN1QDL3kTN0czW}`

## Reference
did by myself
