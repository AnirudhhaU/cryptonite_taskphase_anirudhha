# Catting absolute paths

## Procedure
I started catting absolute paths and after connecting to pwn college through ssh
Then i typed `cat /flag`
and got the flag `pwn.college{0a0vlwJ4VjYnDv02nRhB7H2h5F4.dhzN5QDL3kTN0czW}`

## bash
`hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{cmlMO9rXRRhnfUyG_VQcPy6CUc-.dlTM5QDL3kTN0czW}`
